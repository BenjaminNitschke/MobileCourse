Games Academy Mobile Application Development Course June 2015

Slides and C++ project files for the 3 day Mobile Application Development Course I did at the Games Academy June 2015 in Frankfurt and Berlin.

* Day 1: Platforms Overview
  * Windows, Windows 8, Windows Phone
  * Visual Studio: C++, C#
* Day 2: Open Source Platforms
  * Linux, Android
  * Gcc: C++, Eclipse, IntelliJ: Java
* Day 3: Apple Platforms
  * MacOS, iOS
  * XCode: Objective-C, Swift

On each platform the same Space Invaders game will be created using very different concepts, programming languages, APIs and tools. The purpose is to get a quick overview of all the platforms tools and most importantly get an idea about all the difference and complexities while the basic game code is almost always the same.
